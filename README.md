This is a proof of concept project with implementation of following techniques:

1.) File encryption: One can encrypt/decrypt their file with file encryption methods like AES encryption.

2.) Least Significant Bit: Hide data within an image by changing the least significant bit of every pixel and storing information inside the picture.

3.) Steganography: Hide material inside the image file by storing the bits at the end of the file sequence.
